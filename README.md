# Hey there, my name is Akeem ðŸ¤Ÿ

Hey there, how's it hanging? My name is Akeem Brown, but for formality, it's Mr. Brown. I am a novice-level front-end developer looking to improve my skills through experience and learn more about the world of computer programming. With my technical prowess in a handful of IDEs and languages, and some additional skills, I am confident in my ability in the digital industry... *sometimes*. However, my overconfidence does not come without merit, as I have taken the time to hone my skills with other institutions like CodeSpace and the University of Cape Town. If this has piqued your interest, take a further look at my profile.
